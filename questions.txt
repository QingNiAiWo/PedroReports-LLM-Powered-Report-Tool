Question 1: What is the distribution of BMI across different age groups, and how does it correlate with diabetes outcomes?
Question 2: Analyze the relationship between Glucose levels and Insulin, and their combined impact on diabetes outcome.
Question 3: How does DiabetesPedigreeFunction (genetic influence) vary across age groups, and is there a significant correlation with diabetes outcomes?
Question 4: What is the correlation between Blood Pressure and BMI, and how do these factors influence diabetes risk?
Question 5: Compare the distribution of pregnancies across different age groups and analyze its relationship with diabetes outcomes.

1. How does Blood Glucose Level and BMI correlate with Diabetes Outcome, and what patterns emerge across different age groups?

2. What is the distribution of Diabetes Pedigree Function across different outcome groups, and how does it relate to the number of pregnancies?


3. How do Blood Pressure and Insulin levels vary between diabetic and non-diabetic patients, and is there a clear pattern related to BMI?

4. What is the age distribution of diabetic vs non-diabetic patients, and how does it correlate with skin thickness and glucose levels?
